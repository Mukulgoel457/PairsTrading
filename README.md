# PairsTrading Project

## Project Overview

### Title
**Pair's Trading Analysis and Strategy Development**

This project was showcased at the bootcamp for the Inter IIT Tech Meet organized by the Financial Engineering Club, IIT Guwahati. The main goal was to develop a sophisticated strategy for pair selection in trading scenarios, focusing on the rationale behind each choice.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to explore various strategies for pair trading and identify the most effective method based on quantitative analysis and financial metrics. This involves statistical tests, data visualization, and performance evaluation of different trading pairs.

## Presentation and Collaboration

### Google Colab Notebook
A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google Colab includes all the Python code used in the data analysis and visualization tasks. This tool facilitated a collaborative environment for code development and testing.
